mpd-8tracks
===========

Uses mpc to queue tracks from 8tracks mixes to mpd.

Usage
-----

1. Clone this repo
2. Head on over to http://8tracks.com/developers to register as a developer and get an API key.
3. Voila! That should work. The script will ask for your API key on stdin

Make sure mpd is running and that you have mpc installed. There are further instructions/information in the script itself.
